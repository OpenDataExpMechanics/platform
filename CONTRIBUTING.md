# Contributing to Open Data for Experimental Mechanics

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Open Data for Experimental Mechanics :tada:! 

We are super glad to have you here!

The purpose of the project is to develop and maintain a platform aimed at sharing experimental data and results for the field of experimental mechanics.
The availability of experimental results is limited, because they are scattered in publications. 
The access to experimental data could be beneficial for mechanical engineers and computational engineers to improve their research. 
In publications details necessary to reproduce the experiment or design the simulation for a benchmark are often missing. 
A platform is therefore needed to share experimental data sets in mechanics, 
rating it with respect to reproducibility and quality of the experimental setup for benchmarks with simulation results. 
Thus, both communities could enhance the understanding of material behavior and fasten their research.

If you would like to learn even more about the project and how it came to be, please [take a look at the first post on our blog here}(https://opendataexpmechanics.github.io/ODEM-project/).

This document is a set of guidelines for contributing to Open Data for Experimental Mechanics on GitHub. 
These are guidelines, not rules. This guide is meant to make it easy for you to get involved.

## Participation guidelines

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [contact@http://openexpmechanics.science](http://openexpmechanics.science/).

## What we're working on

This is a good place to link your Roadmap, GitHub Milestones, or Projects so newcomers can see what you're working on.

Take a look at the current issues we are working on [here](https://github.com/OpenDataExpMechanics/platform/issues). 
If you feel like you can help somewhere, let us know by posting a comment in the issue. We can help you get everything set up and assist you to get the platform running on your machine.

Several issues might not even be related to programming, so you can help us there if you are not comfortable coding ! :)

## How to submit changes



Once you've identified one of the issues above that you feel you can contribute to, you're ready to make a change to the project repository!
 
1. **[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository**. This makes your own version of this project you can edit and use.
2. **[Make your changes](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-changes)**! You can do this in the GitHub interface on your own local machine. Once you're happy with your changes...
3. **Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-a-project-with-pull-requests/)**. This opens a discussion around your project and lets the project lead know you are proposing changes.
